Well, that's a good question! ðŸ˜ƒ First I intended to use something cool like Remix to build this website. That would be an excellent chance to learn more about Remix as it has gained alot of popularity recently. However, I like this page to be as simple as possible and considering Jekyll is the original static site generator and this website is served by Github pages, why not?
